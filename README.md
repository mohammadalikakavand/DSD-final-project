# Matrix Multiplier using Verilog

This project is a matrix multiplier developed in Verilog for a Digital System Design course. It uses the divide-and-conquer method to break down matrices into smaller matrices until they are 2x2 units. 

The implementation is done in RTL, and the tests are stored in the test directory. The design code can be found in the RTL directory. 

## Usage

To use the matrix multiplier, you can follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the src directory.
3. Open the Verilog file containing the matrix multiplier implementation.
4. Run the simulation to verify the results.

## Features

This matrix multiplier has the following features:

- Divide-and-conquer method for matrix multiplication
- RTL implementation in Verilog
- Test directory containing tests for different matrix sizes
